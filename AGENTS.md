## Project Overview

Freshell is a self-hosted, browser-accessible terminal multiplexer and session organizer. It provides multi-tab terminal management with support for terminals and coding CLI's like Claude Code and Codex. Key features include session history browsing, AI-powered summaries (via Google Gemini), and remote access over LAN/VPN with token-based authentication.

## Development Philosophy
- We are working on an infinite schedule with infinite tokens. This is unusual! We do not have time pressure, and can do things correctly.
- We use Red-Green-Refactor TDD for all changes but the most trivial (e.g. doc changes). We never skip the tests, and never skip the refactor.
- We ensure both unit test & e2e coverage of everything.
- Before starting anything, think - what's the most idiomatic solution for the technology we're using?
- We prefer clean architecture and correctness over small patches.
- We fix the system over the symptom.

## Repo Rules
- Always work in a worktree (in \.worktrees\)
- Before creating a new worktree, ensure the repo-supported test suite is green on the intended base. If the suite is not green, pause before creating the worktree and notify the user with the failing command and failure summary.
- New behavior changes start on a worktree branch from `origin/main` and are submitted as PRs targeting `main`.
- Do not create or open a PR until the user explicitly approves PR creation for that branch/change. Preparing a branch, committing locally, and pushing the branch is fine; stop before `gh pr create` or any equivalent PR creation step unless approval is explicit.
- Use `dan@danshapiro.com` when using `gh`.
- Everything goes through a PR — never push behavior changes directly to `origin/main`.
- Merge PRs once their required checks pass, then bring `origin/main` down to local `main`. Self-merging your own PRs is the norm. The only exception is a PR the user has said needs someone else to approve it first — leave those unmerged.
- Many agents may be working in the worktree at the same time. If you see activity from other agents (for example test runs or file changes), respect it.
- Specific user instructions override ALL other instructions, including the above, and including superpowers or skills
- Server uses NodeNext/ESM; relative imports must include `.js` extensions
- Always consider checking logs for debugging; server logs (including client console logs) are in the server process stdout/stderr (e.g., `npm run dev`/`npm start`).
- Debug logging toggle (UI Settings → Debugging → Debug logging) enables debug-level logs and perf logging; keep OFF outside perf investigations.
- When adding new user-facing features or making significant UI changes, update `docs/index.html` to reflect them. It's a nonfunctional mock of the default experience, so only major changes need to be added.

## Test Coordination
- Broad repo-supported test runs wait for the shared coordinator gate; if another agent holds it, wait rather than kill a foreign holder.
- Set `FRESHELL_TEST_SUMMARY` when you want holder/status output to show a human-meaningful reason for a broad run.
- Use `npm run test:status` to inspect the current holder, recent results, and any advisory reusable baseline.
- Use `npm run test:vitest -- ...` for a repo-owned direct Vitest path. Raw `npx vitest` is not a coordinated workflow.
- `test:unit` is the exact default-config `test/unit` workload, `test:integration` is the exact server-config `test/server` workload, and `test:server` stays watch-capable unless you pass an explicit broad `--run`.

## Kata
- `.kata.toml` is committed project configuration. Always commit it after modifying it.

## Branch Model And Self-Hosting (CRITICAL - Read This)

**Freshell no longer uses a local `dev` integration branch.**

- `main` is the only integration branch. Local `main` should track the merged state of `origin/main`.
- Author changes in dedicated `.worktrees/<slug>` worktrees on feature branches created from `origin/main`.
- Do not commit behavior changes directly to local `main` or push them directly to `origin/main`.
- When a change is ready, push the feature branch, ask the user for explicit approval to create the PR, open a PR targeting `main` only after that approval, wait for required checks, merge the PR, then update local `main` from `origin/main`.
- Update local `main` with a fast-forward pull or merge only. If local `main` has local-only commits, a dirty worktree, or cannot fast-forward, stop and resolve that explicitly instead of creating a local merge commit.
- Delete or retire obsolete local `dev` worktrees/branches after confirming they are not running the self-hosted Freshell process.

## Process Safety (CRITICAL)

- Never use broad kill patterns (for example `pkill -f "tsx watch server/index.ts"`, `pkill -f vite`, `pkill node`).
- Start manual worktree servers on a unique port and record their PID, then stop only that PID.
- Dev mode example (full hot reload — Vite client HMR + tsx-watch server): `NODE_ENV=development PORT=3344 npm run dev > /tmp/freshell-3344.log 2>&1 & echo $! > /tmp/freshell-3344.pid`, then open `http://localhost:5173/?token=<AUTH_TOKEN from .env>` (Vite proxies `/api` + `/ws` to the server port).
  - `NODE_ENV=development` is required: a lingering `NODE_ENV=production` in the shell (e.g. left by `npm start`) makes `isDev` false, so the server skips the Vite path and `/` 404s on `client/index.html`.
  - Server-only hot reload (no client UI): `PORT=3344 npm run dev:server ...` instead.
- Production mode example (built dist): `PORT=3344 npm start > /tmp/freshell-3344.log 2>&1 & echo $! > /tmp/freshell-3344.pid`
  - **NEVER run `node dist/server/index.js` directly** — use `npm start` which sets `NODE_ENV=production`; without it the server prints the Vite port (5173) in the startup URL even though Vite isn't running
- Example stop: `kill "$(cat /tmp/freshell-3344.pid)" && rm -f /tmp/freshell-3344.pid`
- Before stopping any process, verify it belongs to the worktree (`ps -fp <pid>` and confirm cwd/path includes `.worktrees/...`).
- **The self-hosted Freshell server must never be restarted without explicit user approval (the word "APPROVED").** Building is fine; deploying (stop + start) is not. The user's current Freshell session depends on it, and an unapproved restart will disconnect them mid-operation.

## Codex Agent in CMD Instructions (Codex agents only; only when running in CMD on windows; all other agents must ignore)
- Prefer bash/WSL over PowerShell; Windows paths map like `D:\...` -> `/mnt/d/...`.
- Use `bash -lc "<cmd>"` for non-interactive commands; avoid interactive shells so commands return control.
- Apply_patch expects Windows-style paths.
- If a bash command produces no visible output, rerun with `tty: true` to force output.
- PowerShell may hang for dozens of seconds before starting in this tool; stick to bash unless explicitly required.
- Don't make silly mistakes like installing Linux binaries in node_modules when we're on windows

## Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev                 # Run client + server concurrently with hot reload
npm run dev:client          # Vite dev server only (port 5173)
npm run dev:server          # Node with tsx watch for server auto-reload
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build               # Full build (client + server)
npm run build:client        # Vite build → dist/client
npm run build:server        # TypeScript compile → dist/server
npm run serve               # Build and run production server
# `npm run serve` prompts before serving from a non-main branch; use
# `FRESHELL_ALLOW_NON_MAIN_SERVE=1 npm run serve` only when intentional.
# Note: `npm run build` is guarded — it will refuse to overwrite dist/
# if a production server is detected on the configured PORT. Use
# `npm run check` for safe verification, or build from a worktree.
```

Windows desktop builds (`npm run electron:build:win`) must run on native Windows — see [docs/development/windows-electron-build.md](docs/development/windows-electron-build.md).

### Testing
```bash
npm test                    # Coordinated full suite (default + server configs)
npm run check               # Typecheck, then coordinated full suite
npm run verify              # Build, then coordinated full suite
npm run test:coverage       # Coordinated default-config coverage run
npm run test:status         # Show active holder, latest results, and advisory baseline info
npm run test:vitest -- ...  # Repo-owned direct Vitest path for focused passthrough work
```

External provider contract tests (`test/integration/real/`) spawn real `claude`, `codex`, and `opencode` binaries to verify external provider behavior, not Freshell code. They are opt-in and skipped by default to avoid blocking the coordinated suite on environment-dependent flakiness:
```bash
FRESHELL_RUN_REAL_PROVIDER_CONTRACTS=1 npm run test:vitest -- \
  run test/integration/real/ --config config/vitest/vitest.server.config.ts
```

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18, Redux Toolkit, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, xterm.js, Zod
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express, node-pty, WebSocket (ws), Chokidar, Vercel AI SDK + Google Generative AI
- **Testing:** Vitest, Testing Library, supertest, superwstest

### Directory Structure
- `src/` - React frontend application
  - `components/` - UI components (TabBar, Sidebar, TerminalView, HistoryView, etc.)
  - `store/` - Redux slices (tabs, connection, sessions, settings, claude)
  - `lib/` - Utilities (api.ts, claude-types.ts)
- `server/` - Node.js/Express backend
  - `index.ts` - HTTP/REST routes and server entry
  - `ws-handler.ts` - WebSocket protocol handler
  - `terminal-registry.ts` - PTY lifecycle management
  - `claude-session.ts` - Claude session discovery & indexing
  - `claude-indexer.ts` - File watcher for ~/.claude directory
- `test/` - Test suites organized by unit/integration and client/server

### Key Architectural Patterns

**WebSocket Protocol:** Schema-validated messages using Zod. Handshake flow: client sends `hello` with token → server validates → sends `ready`. Message types include `terminal.create/input/resize/detach/attach` and broadcasts like `sessions.updated`.

**PTY Lifecycle:** Each terminal has a unique ID. Server maintains 64KB scrollback buffer. On attach, client receives buffer snapshot then streams new output. On detach, process continues running (background session). Configurable idle timeout (15 mins default).

**Claude Session Discovery:** Watches `~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl` for new files. Parses JSONL streams to extract messages, groups by project path.

**Redux State Management:** Slices for tabs, panes, connection, sessions, settings, claude. Persist middleware saves tabs and panes to localStorage. Async thunks for API calls.

**Configuration Persistence:** User config stored at `~/.freshell/config.json`. Atomic writes with temp file + rename. Settings changes POST to `/api/settings` and broadcast via WebSocket.

**Pane System:** Tabs contain pane layouts (tree structure of splits). Each pane owns its terminal lifecycle via `createRequestId` and `terminalId`. When splitting panes, each new pane gets its own `createRequestId`, ensuring independent backend terminals. Pane content types: `terminal` (with mode, shell, status) and `browser` (with URL, devtools state).

**Concern OS Existing-Pane Input:** Stage 1 attaches to tmux-owned Amplifier panes without creating or resuming processes. Initial capture validates the exact configured tmux socket plus tmux-server, pane, and Amplifier PID generations and issues a short-lived generation-bound lease. A live in-memory lease may transition once from `amplifier_bound` to `shell_continuation` only after the exact Amplifier process is definitely gone (`ENOENT`/`ESRCH`) and a successful exact-pane operation plus revalidation; the tmux socket, server generation, pane generation, token, TTL, and FIFO/replay namespace remain immutable, while initial/unleased and expired requests never transition or reacquire. Focused browser polling renews the lease through full validation. Accepted trusted keyboard/paste input wakes a single-flight capture scheduler and extends a bounded 50 ms post-input polling burst; idle focused panes poll every 250 ms, hidden/unfocused panes every 750 ms, and no local terminal echo is synthesized. Input is coalesced for one frame, allows only one HTTP request in flight, coalesces later bytes into bounded UTF-8-safe successor chunks, delivers FIFO with monotonic replay rejection, revalidates all `/proc` generations immediately before an atomic tmux identity-check-plus-`send-keys -H` transaction, and fails closed on stale identity. Exact capture/input routes skip the general pre-auth API limiter but remain auth-protected behind a dedicated high-frequency limiter. A selected live existing pane may focus xterm only in response to the ephemeral monotonic tab `focusActivation` intent emitted by explicit sidebar/tab activation, after its first validated render, and while the browser document is visible and focused; each intent is consumed once and must not steal focus from dialogs, menus, text/search inputs, unrelated controls, inactive panes, or historical read-only views. Never replace this path with shell interpolation, a bare/default tmux socket, name-based targeting, per-keystroke catalog reconciliation, overlapping capture requests, incidental-rerender focus, synthetic local echo, lease persistence, or lifecycle commands.

**Agent Status Indicators:** Blue/busy status is derived from provider activity slices through `resolvePaneActivity`; green/needs-attention and the idle sound flow through `recordTurnComplete` and `useTurnCompletionNotifications`. Turn-complete (green/sound) is server-authoritative everywhere: terminal CLIs via `terminal.turn.complete`, and fresh-agent panes (freshclaude/kilroy/freshcodex/freshopencode) via a discrete `freshAgent.turn.complete` edge emitted only on a positive completion — freshclaude/kilroy on the SDK `result` with `subtype === 'success'`, freshopencode on the success-only `emitStatus(idle)` path, and freshcodex on `turn/completed` only when `params.turn.status === 'completed'` (the notification also fires on interrupt). The client folds it in via `applyFreshAgentCompletion` using the `at`-monotonic dedupe regime (wall-clock `at`, no per-session counter, so a resumed durable session can't swallow completions across a server restart). The waiting-for-approval edge is ALSO server-authoritative: the Claude/kilroy `SdkBridge` emits a discrete `freshAgent.turn.waiting` edge on the 0→≥1 pending permission/question transition (only Claude/kilroy raise approvals/questions), and the client folds it in via `applyFreshAgentWaiting` under a distinct `${provider}:${sessionId}#waiting` dedupe namespace so it can never poison (or be poisoned by) the turn-complete bucket. The fragile client-side busy→idle derivation AND the client-side waiting-edge hook (`useAgentSessionTurnCompletion`) were both removed — all green/sound edges are now server-emitted. freshcodex additionally self-heals a crashed/disconnected codex sidecar by consuming the runtime `onExit` hook in `subscribe()`, emitting `sdk.status:'exited'` to clear BLUE (no chime — a crash is not a positive completion). `freshopencode` still runs on a shared long-lived `opencode serve` sidecar and uses server-pushed `session.idle`/`session.status` events to drive busy. Gemini and Kimi terminal modes are status-inert until their CLIs expose a reliable turn-complete signal.

**Fresh-Agent Orchestration:** The REST agent API (`/api/tabs`, `/api/panes/:id/split`, `/api/panes/:id/send-keys`, `/api/panes/:id/capture`, `/api/panes/:id/wait-for`) and the MCP `freshell` tool accept `agent`/`model`/`effort` parameters to create and drive fresh-agent panes (e.g. `agent=opencode`). The orchestration layer dispatches to the registered `FreshAgentRuntimeManager`, so the same external surface works for any fresh-agent provider.

### Data Flow

1. Browser loads → fetches settings from `/api/settings` and sessions from `/api/sessions`
2. WebSocket connects → client sends `hello` with auth token → server sends `ready`
3. Terminal creation → Pane content has `createRequestId` → UI sends `terminal.create` WS message with that ID → server spawns PTY → sends back `terminal.created` with `terminalId` → pane content updated
4. Terminal I/O → `terminal.input` WS messages write to PTY stdin → stdout/stderr streams to attached clients

## Accessibility (A11y) Requirements

All components **must** be accessible for browser-use automation and WCAG compliance:

**Semantic HTML:**
- Use `<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`, `<label>` for interactive elements (not div with onClick)
- Use semantic headers (`<h1>`-`<h6>`), nav, main, aside
- Use proper form structure with labels associated to controls

**ARIA & Labels:**
- Icon-only buttons: `aria-label="Description"` or `<span className="sr-only">`
- Clickable cards/tiles: `role="button"` + `aria-label`
- Custom components: appropriate roles and ARIA props
- Complex widgets: `aria-expanded`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-selected` where applicable

**Browser-use Requirements:**
- All interactive elements must be indexable (semantic HTML or proper roles)
- All interactive elements must be identifiable (visible text or aria-label)
- Never rely on selectors for automation; fix accessibility instead

**Linting:**
- Run `npm run lint` to check a11y violations (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)
- Fix with `npm run lint:fix` for auto-fixable issues
- A11y linting is CI requirement before merging
